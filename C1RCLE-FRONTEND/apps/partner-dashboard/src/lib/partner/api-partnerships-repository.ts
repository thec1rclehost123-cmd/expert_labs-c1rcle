/**
 * ─── Partnerships (venue ↔ host) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The venue-side half of the partnership graph. Every route here is
 * org-scoped server-side and `validateV2` is strict about `X-Organization-Id`
 * matching the `:organizationId` path segment (see
 * `apps/api-gateway/src/routes/v2/partner/partnerships.ts` — `readHeaders` /
 * `commandHeaders`), so the header is sent on every call including the
 * partnership-level commands, whose paths carry only `:partnershipId`.
 *
 * `Idempotency-Key` is "one per user intent, not per retry". Every mutation
 * here takes an optional `idempotencyKey` so a caller that retries the *same*
 * intent (a double-click, a network retry) can replay the same key and get the
 * original response back instead of negotiating the rate twice. Callers that
 * don't care get a fresh key per call, which is correct for a deliberate
 * re-negotiation.
