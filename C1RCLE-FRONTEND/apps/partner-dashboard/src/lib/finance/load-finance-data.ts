 * loader is pure (repository → view model → props), so the screen components
 * stay presentational and the only place that knows about cookies, org scoping
 * and HTTP is this file.
 *
 * WHY SERVER-SIDE: the finance desk is a first paint, not an interaction. It
 * also avoids the failure mode that matters most here — a browser fetch that
 * 401s or 500s must not leave a fixture balance on screen next to real bank
 * details. If the API cannot answer, this throws and the route's error boundary
 * says so; it never degrades to placeholder numbers.

 * active org needs to pick one, and only a transient failure is worth a retry
 * button. Collapsing them into one generic error would offer "Try again" to
 * someone whose session is gone, which cannot succeed.
 *
 *  - `signed-out` — a session cookie was present but the gateway rejected it.
 *    Cookie-*less* requests never reach here: the proxy redirects those to
 *    `/login` before the route renders. This is the stale-cookie case.
 *  - `no-organization` — authenticated, but no `c1rcle.active-org` hint, so
 *    there is no tenant to read.
 *  - `forbidden` — authenticated, but not a member of the org in the cookie.
 *  - `api` — anything else. Retryable, so it gets a retry affordance.
