 *
 * WHY SERVER-SIDE: the overview is a first paint, not an interaction. It also
 * avoids the failure that matters most here — a browser fetch that 401s or 500s
 * must not leave a fixture revenue chart on screen next to a real event list. If
 * the API cannot answer, this throws and the route's error boundary says so. It
 * never degrades to placeholder numbers.

 * — and asking for one granularity and re-bucketing client-side would either
